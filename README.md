# Migration model


Ever since the prehistoric times when humans were known to walk the Earth as nomads, we have always seeked new shelters in search of new possibilities. In the 21st century, migration is especially at the center of discussion. There are numerous factors contributing to migration; however, one common denominator is to search for a better perceived future. The International Organization for Migration estimated more than 244 million international migrants live in a foreign country in 2015. In this project we focus on the economic, social, and environmental factors that drive population movements. To better our understanding of how these factors come into play, we attempt to model migration using Netlogo and study the behavior of the model
based on these factors alone.
